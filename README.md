# cows-and-wolves
a simplistic game about cows, wolves, wheat and meat that is playable in a terminal

A single crop of wheat appears every 3 days
A crop of wheat grows in 2 days

Cows can eat wheat
Cows who ate some multiply the next day
Cows can be killed to get meat

Wolves like eating cows
2 new wolves appear every 2 days
Wolves will go away if given meat (note, they do not go away after eating cows, only after you give them meat)

Try to make your cows last as long as possible

this game was made in the span of 2 days while in a car trip
